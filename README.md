# Overview #

This project involved a detailed analysis of a dataset containing 1,000 sample crowdfunding projects. The primary objective was to uncover hidden trends and factors that contribute to the success or failure of crowdfunding campaigns. Using Microsoft Excel, various analytical techniques were employed to dissect and understand the data.

- Conditional Formatting: Applied to visually differentiate campaign outcomes and the degree of funding achieved.
- Column Creation and Manipulation: Generated new columns for enhanced data insights, including 'Percent Funded', 'Average Donation', 'Parent Category', 'Sub-Category', 'Date Created Conversion', and 'Date Ended Conversion'.
- Pivot Tables and Charts: Developed comprehensive pivot tables and charts to analyze data across different dimensions such as campaign outcomes per category and sub-category, and outcomes based on launch dates.
- Crowdfunding Goal Analysis: Created a detailed breakdown of campaign outcomes against various funding goal ranges, providing insights into the relationship between set goals and campaign success or failure.
- Statistical Analysis: Conducted an in-depth analysis of campaign backers, computing key statistical measures like mean, median, variance, and standard deviation, to understand the behavior of backers in successful and unsuccessful campaigns.
## Visualization and Reporting ##
- Graphical Representation: Constructed various charts including stacked-column pivot charts and line graphs to visually represent data trends and relationships.
- Written Analysis: Compiled a comprehensive report summarizing key findings, drawing conclusions from the data, discussing dataset limitations, and suggesting additional analytical approaches.
